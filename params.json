This is the website that I made for my Spark project.\r\n\r\nI created a game with the help of my mentor, using Blender, which took about 7 weeks.\r\n\r\n![game photo 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajimenez12/ajimenez12.github.io/master/Screenshot%202016-11-29%2014.59.35.png)\r\n\r\nIn this game the idea is that the character is in a forest and he has to pass thru it to get to the finish line. We added some obstacles for the player to navigate thru. One of the ways that the player can lose is by falling into the water.\r\n\r\nI also created a website to show my game and give people a way to download and play it.\r\n\r\n[Download Now](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5c57V3oY-afdHc5SDhnRlJPdTg/view?usp=sharing)\r\n",
